# /Buddy/

An app created with Node.js, React and React-Bootstrap

## The idea behind /Buddy/

/Buddy/ was created to demonstrate the fundamentals of React. It is a social-networking platform designed to help other users find specific types of connections, relationships and social-circles.

A user can create a profile on the /Create Your Profile/ page as well as Login to a profile on the /Login/ page and view other public profiles on the /Explore/ page. A user can like/unlike another user-profile that interests them. Liked profiles will appear in the /Buddy List/ on the user's personal /Profile/ page. On the /Profile/ page, a user can view their personal profile, unlike a liked public profile, and delete their personal profile.

In it's current state, /Buddy/ uses db.json as its backend and does not contain the ability to interact with other users. A user can login to an existing profile using the name stored in the profile data.

## the Future of /Buddy/

While studies show that as age increases the ability to form new connections decreases, it's also becoming more apparent that people want to make new friends and connections beyond early adulthood. Most generations use technology to enrich their social and the desire to seek out a romantic partner is being eclipsed by the desire to find community. While /Buddy/ in its current state is a template, its potential as a social-networking app is huge.
